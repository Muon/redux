# Redux

Redux is an alternative to Rescript, [Achron](http://www.achrongame.com/)'s
native scripting language. It is currently under development.

Redux requires [PLY](http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) for lexing and parsing,
which can be installed with `pip install ply`.

Run `python -m redux` in this directory to run the compiler.

Run `nosetests` in this directory to run unit tests.
